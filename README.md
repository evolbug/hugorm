## What is Hugorm?

It is a dynamically typed programming language. Hugorm strives to be *better* version of the other snake language, with a heightened focus on \<good things here\>. The syntax is designed to be easy to read and easy to write, and runs on a constantly improving bytecode virtual machine.

### Selling points

> "Sssssss ..." - hugorm

- [x] Decently fast
- [x] Easy-to-learn syntax
- [x] Made in Rust
- [x] The REPL has colors
- [ ] ~~Absolutely massive community~~
- [x] Surprising bugs, maybe

## Examples

Everyone loves examples. Below are some rather useless example programs, showcasing the raw syntax of Hugorm.

### Functions
> Literally fun.

### Data

### Interfaces

An interface will work like a set of pre-made functions that can be bound to new objects. Kinda like the way you implement traits on a struct in Rust.

## The future

### Web

In the future, I want to have inline web things.
